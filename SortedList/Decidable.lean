/-- Decide whether an arbitrary list is Sorted.

This is not only an algorithm for checking if an arbitrary list is sorted,
but also a "proof machine" capable of constructing the proof that it is or isn't!

-- The above fact is already proved in the Lean standard library
example (xs : List Int) : Decidable (Sorted xs) := instDecidablePairwise xs

-- Therefore the following instance is redundant
instance {xs : List Int} : Decidable (Sorted xs) := Sorted.decide xs

-- What lean computes here is not merely a boolean, but a complete **proof object**,
-- which contains the mathematical proof that the list is sorted.
#eval Sorted [1, 2, 3, 3]

-- Similarly it computes here a proof that the list is not sorted.
#eval Sorted [1, 2, 3, 2]
